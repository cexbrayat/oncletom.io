**Thomas Parisot** is my full name and people often call me *Tom*.
Hence my long lasting nickname â€” *Oncle Tom* â€” a friendly pun to our *digital slavery*.

I am a Frenchman in London [dtc innovation](https://dtc-innovation.org) co-op co-founder and **Senior web engineer**, volunteer at [Organic Lea farm](https://www.organiclea.org.uk) and *bread maker* apprentice.

I used to work at [BBC R&D](http://bbc.co.uk/rd) and to co-organise and curate the [Sud Web](https://sudweb.fr/) event.

Overall, I use web technologies to *prototype*, to *empower* and to *design* for great user experiences and for a better civic society.

## Values

I highly believe in **openness**, **craftsmanship** and **sustainability**.

Through my acts, I do not want to create more *unbalance* or to leave a debt behind me.

Hence I will do my best to favour **non-profit**, **ethical** or **greater good** organisations.

## Professional experience

I have **more than 10 years of professional experience** in the web industry through various roles and responsibilities:

- *Senior web engineer* at [dtc innovation](https://dtc-innovation.org) co-op;
- *Senior web engineer* at [BBC R&D](http://bbc.co.uk/rd);
- *CTO* and *co-founder* of [Dijiwan, a startup which failed](/2014/why-our-startup-failed/);
- *Web consultant* in my own limited company;
- *Web consultant* at [Clever Age](http://en.clever-age.com/), a renowned French Web engineering agency;
- *Web developer* in a nation-wide retail group.

## Can we get in touch?

Maybe we will meet in the *Underground* by chance (although now I *cycle to work*).
Maybe we will meet in an exhibition somewhere in Europe.
Maybe we will meet in a backpacker hostel somewhere in the World.

Or maybe [we will simply start with an email](mailto:&#104;&#105;&#064;&#111;&#110;&#099;&#108;&#101;&#116;&#111;&#109;&#046;&#105;&#111; "Contact") ðŸ˜Š

We can definitely break the ice around a glass of wine, a cup of tea or a nice meal.
